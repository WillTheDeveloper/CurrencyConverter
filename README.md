# CurrencyConverter

TLDR; Project for college.

This is a task that I have to do prior to the Christmas break at college (2021).

The idea of this project is to be able to convert currencies from one to another with an easy to use application.

It is written in C sharp and uses Windows forms inside visual studio to build the user interface.

This project is not intended to be continued after I have finished it. It does use semantic versioning so you can determine whether its finished or not.

Feel free to fork it and improve it.
